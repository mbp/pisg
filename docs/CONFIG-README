README for pisg.cfg - the configuration file for pisg
------------------
This file is used for:
 - Setting user options (for user aliases, pics, ignores and links)
 - Setting up channel(s) to be parsed.
 - Setting pisg config options (for general things with pisg)
 - Word options (for adding words that are meant to be 'foul(bad) language')


USER OPTIONS
------------------
User options are set with a simple SGML like syntax in the form:

    <user nick="NICK" option="VALUE">

Remember, the nick is always required.

For example to add aliases to a nick, then you could do this:
    <user nick="Joe" alias="Joe^*">

This will add all Joe^'s to 'Joe' in the stats.

Another thing you can do is to add a picture to a user:
    <user nick="Ben" pic="ben_holiday.jpg">

You can also set a user's sex:
    <user nick="Ben" sex="m">

Also you can add links to URLs and e-mails:
    <user nick="Christine" link="http://www.christine.com">

    or

    <user nick="Chris" link="chris@host.com">

The last thing you can do is to ignore nicks (for example bots):
    <user nick="nameofbot" ignore="y">

You don't have to do all this in many lines, you could just as easily do:
<user nick="Joe" alias="Joe^away Joe^work" pic="joe.jpg" link="joe@joe.com" sex="m">

(Here the aliases is a space seperated list of nicks, that also works! But *
as a wildcard is smarter, but also slower).

CHANNELS SETUP
------------------

For each of your channels which you want to parse through, you make
something like this:

<channel="#channel" logfile="channel.log">
 format = "mIRC"
 maintainer = "NameOfMaintainer"
</channel>

Any options in the <channel *> section will be forced, even over commandline
options... any options before </channel> can be overridden from command line

There is a lot of options which you can set between the <channel> and
</channel> tags, these are listed in the next section.

PISG OPTIONS
------------------
If you have multiple channels, then you can set some defaults for them, for
example you can do.

<set format="mIRC">

And you won't have to worry about setting the format for every channel.

You can also combine settings into one line such as:
<set channel="#channel" logfile="/var/log/channel.log">

All the different options are listed below.

Other examples:
<set lang='EN'>
<set bgcolor="#dedeee" text="black" hbgcolor="#666699" hcolor="white" hicell="#BABADD" hicell2="#CCCCCC">
<set show_voice="1" show_wpl="1">
<set topichistory="3" timeoffset="+0">

There is many options which can be set, here's a list of them all (not
casesensitive):

 * The most useful ones *

channel             The name of your channel. E.g. '#mychannel'
                    (default: unset)

logfile             The exact filename of the logfile. E.g. 'mylog.log'
                    (default: unset)

logsuffix           Regexes to sort logfiles by in format month||day||year
                    Note: example will work for eggdrop's default format
                    Example: logsuffix="\.\d\d([A-Za-z]+)\d\d\d\d||\.(\d\d)[A-Za-z]+\d\d\d\d||\.\d\d[A-Za-z]+(\d\d\d\d)"
                    (default: unset)

format              The logfile format. See FORMATS file for supported formats

network             Network the channel is using. E.g. 'Undernet'

outputfile          Outputted stats goes to this HTML file.
                    (default: index.html)

maintainer          The maintainer or bot which makes the logfile.

lang                Language to use (see lang.txt)
                    EN | DE | DK | FR | ES | PL | PT | NO | NL | SE | EE | IT
                    HU | SI | FI 

pagehead            Some 'page header' file which you want to include in top
                    of the output file.
                    (default: none)

imagepath           If your user pictures is located in a special direcotry,
                    set the path here. E.g. 'userpics/'
                    (default: current directory)

default_pic         If no picture defined for a user, use this default
                    picture, good for example to display 'No picture
                    available'.

logdir              If you specify a path to a directory here, then pisg will
                    run through the files in that directory, parse all
                    logfiles in it and create 1 HTML file from it. Useful
                    with eggdrops.

                    prefixed by xxx

                    one hour to the stats.

WORD OPTIONS
------------------
pisg has the feature of making stats of people using "foul words" or bad
language, like fuck, shit, etc. but this is something people would like to
configure to their own language and slang.

So this option configures which words which are considered to be "foul":

<set foul="ass bitch fuck">

Or in German:
<set foul="scheisse scheiße kacke">

pisg also recognizes that people may attack others in a variety of ways.
The words that pisg considers to be attacks may be set with the "violent"
option:

<set violent="slaps beats kicks">

Have fun configuring pisg! :)


LINKS
------------------
It's possible to ignore links in the 'most referenced URLs' section:
<link url="http://www.slashdot.org" ignore="y">
